***
In traditional attendance system, the students are called out by the teachers and their presence or absence is marked accordingly. However, these traditional techniques are time consuming and tedious. A facial recognition system is a computerized software which is suited for determining or validating a person by performing comparison on patterns based on their facial appearances.

### MOTIVATION
The main motivation behind this project is to understand the concepts of machine learning and how can we use person's face that has distinctive physical shape and characteristics which can be used to identify and verify an individual. Moreover, this project will save alot of time and solve errors which generally occurs in manual attendance.

### HOW TO CONNECT DATABASE?
1. Run Apache and MySQl in background using Xampp.
2. Open browser and search for phpMyAdmin.
3. Click on new and give database name as "mydatabase", table name as "student".
4. Hit go and your database is ready to store information.
#### *Note: Database name as "mydatabase" and table name as "student" is according to my project if you want to change it you can but then you have to make changes in your code file also.*

### RESULT ANALYSIS
The interface for the Smart Attendance System has been created. Using the interface the images of the individual students is being recorded and stored in the database i.e. Text 
File. Finally the images of the students is being tracked and recognized.
1. The different folders have been created.
2. The interface for the Face Recognition Based Attendance System in which the Name, Rollnumber, Fatherâ€™s Name, Course and Section of the respective students are stored.
3. The images are stored in a folder named "images".
4. Using phpMyAdmin database student table for the student details is created.
5. The images of the students is trained.
